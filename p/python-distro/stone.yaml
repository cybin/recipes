summary     : distro provides information about the OS distribution it runs on
description : |
    distro provides information about the OS distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or version information.

    It is the recommended replacement for Python's original platform.linux_distribution function (removed in Python 3.8). It also
    provides much more functionality which isn't necessarily Python bound, like a command-line interface.
