summary     : ModDB Reader
description : |
    The goal of the library is to be able to navigate ModDB purely programmatically through scraping and parsing of
    the various models present on the website. This is based off a command of my bot which can parse either a game
    or a mod, this command gave birth to the original library which was extremely limited in its abilities and only
    able to parse a few pages with inconsistencies. This library is a much more mature and professional attempt at
    the whole idea, adding on a much deeper understanding of OOP.
